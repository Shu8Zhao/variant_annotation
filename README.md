# variant_annotation
For this task, I used existing program "SnpEff" to conduct the effect predicition 
using vcf file as input. Then I wrote a small piece of perl script to parse the desired 
information and generate the output csv file.

This folder contains three files: "README.md", "parse_annotation.pl", "output.csv". "parse_annotation.pl" and 
"output.csv" contain the perl script and final output file, respectively.
